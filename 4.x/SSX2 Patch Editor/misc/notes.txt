Todo:
-Rename CameraPivot to MainCamera and make it a Node. Have get_pivot() and get_camera()
-Add a distance from camera plane function to the camera autoload
-Make a bubble database where it stores, spawns, deletes, and click detect bubbles.
-Rewrite Bubble manager so a function can be called to get the bubble on top of the mouse.
-Review the transform system and see if it can be improved in readability and complexity
-Create Rotation and scaling for the transformer
-Create transforming for the corners
-Add handle lines. Maybe put it on the BubbleManager

-Finish transformer component for handles





-Note that handle transformer component code is messy, clean up afterwards.
