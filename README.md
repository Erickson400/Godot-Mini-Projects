# My Godot Mini-Projects

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Here are my Godot projects and tech demos. I’ve bundled them into one repo because I wasn’t interested in publishing them individually

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Many of them were personal experiments to test out Godot features or try new ideas. Sometimes I reuse parts of these projects in larger ones, or merge them to create bigger things. Some examples:
- Car System
- Fractals
- Raytrace
- Bezier Surface Shader
\
\
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Some were more ambitious projects that never made it to completion, usually because I overestimated my skills or underestimated the commitment needed. I learned the hard way. Some of these are:
- Real Estate Fun
- Vectory
- Wendy (**check out the idea doc file in the folder - you might find it interesting**)
- Vosta vector model editor
\
\
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fortunately, a few projects did reach a somewhat finished state. I'm greatful to have them here and I encourage you to give them a try. They’re probably not big enough to justify standalone repos. In the probable future, one of them is gonna peak my interest again, and I'll build on top of them to make something better. Some of these are:
- Inside Colors Animation (*my favorite*)
- SSX2 Patch Editor (*just a prototype for a bigger project, but well executed till the end*)
-Math Training
- CVG Strikes Back (*A follow up to my [sure-shot](https://github.com/Erickson400/sure-shot-gd) port to godot by MDickie*)
